# Swift Algorithms

An open-source package that will host algorithms as a study excersice.

The goal is to **explain/understand** how algorithms work with focus on make a reusable package.
That said this can hold algorithms common excersices and tipical interview tasks but as internal (not exposed in the package).

This is for study porpuses so don't worry if we duplicate implementations for big sources like:
[raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club)
[apple/swift-algorithms](https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms)

## Contribution Guidelines
Just open a Pull Request, we only ask to follow this simple guidelines:

* Add description and explanation of the algorithm under **Guides**.
* Create a *algorithm.swift* file under **Sources/Algoritms** that contains the implementation.
* Add Unit Tests, create a *algorithmTests.swift* file under **Tests/AlgorithmsTests* that contains the tests.
* If posible document the code added and mention the complexity [Big-O notation](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club/blob/master/Big-O%20Notation.markdown). 

You can also fix typos, add UT, add better docs, every contribution is welcome.
