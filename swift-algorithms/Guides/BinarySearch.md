#  Binary Search

“Binary search is one of the most efficient searching algorithms with a time complexity of O(log n). This is comparable with searching for an element inside a balanced binary search tree.
There are two conditions that need to be met before binary search may be used:
The collection must be able to perform index manipulation in constant time. This means that the collection must be a RandomAccessCollection.
The collection must be sorted.”
