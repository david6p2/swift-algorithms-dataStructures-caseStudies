# DataStructures

An open-source package that will host data structures as a study excersice.

The goal is to **explain/understand** common data structures with focus on make a reusable package.

This is for study porpuses so don't worry if we duplicate implementations for big sources like:

* [raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club)

## Contribution Guidelines
Just open a Pull Request, we only ask to follow this simple guidelines:

* Add description of the data structure under **Guides**.
* Create a *datastructure.swift* file under **Sources/DataStructures** that contains the implementation.
* Add Unit Tests, create a *dataStructureTests.swift* file under **Tests/DataStructuresTests* that contains the tests.
* If posible document the code added. 

You can also fix typos, add UT, add better docs, every contribution is welcome.
